### Game description
The game is an endless runner that runs on Android. Using a grappling hook, the player must avoid the incoming obstacles such as saws, falling boxes and the hot steam from broken pipes. The difficulty and complexity of the obstacles increases with the time you managed to survive in the current run. Because of this, the player is also helped with superpowers that can speed you up, freeze the time, or give you a jetpack for a better handling.
The game also has a story mode, where you can play 21 predefined levels. The first levels serve as tutorials for the game, while the last ones can prove to be very challenging, even for an experienced gamer.
The game features a Facebook login. Initially you could see the scores of your friends in a leaderboard, but the API changed and this feature no longer works. 

### How to play
The user controls the game character by pressing the phone screen. By doing so, the character will launch the grappling hook from his pistol in that direction. When the hook will hit a wall, the player will be drawn to it, as long as the user is still touching the screen. By keeping the finger on the screen even after the charcter has reached the wall, the player will simply stay there until the finger is taken off the screen. The gun can be fired again at any time, even before reaching the wall.
The controll changes slightly when the jetpack power up is taken. In this case, touching the screen will make the player to go to exactly that positon. Unlike the grappling hook, the moving direction is continuously changed based on the current position of the finger, thus allowing him to have a more precise movement.
